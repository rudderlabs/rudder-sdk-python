# RudderStack Python SDK

RudderStackâ€™s Python SDK lets you track events from your Python application. Once enabled, the event requests hit the RudderStack servers. RudderStack then transforms and routes these events to your specified destination platforms.

More details on the Python SDK can be found in our [**documentation**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-python-sdk)

## Getting Started with Python SDK

Install `rudder-sdk-python` using `pip`:

```bash
pip install rudder-sdk-python
```

## Initializing the RudderStack Client

```python
import rudderstack.analytics as analytics

analytics.write_key = <SOURCE_WRITE_KEY>
analytics.on_error = <FAILURE CALLBACK>
analytics.debug = <True or False>
analytics.dataPlaneUrl = <RUDDERSTACK_DATA_PLANE_URL>

analytics.gzip = <True or False>
```

## Sending Events

Once the RudderStack client is initialized, you can use it to send your customer events. A sample `track` call is shown below:

```python
rudder_analytics.track('developer_user_id', 'Simple Track Event', {
  'key1': 'val1'
})
analytics.track('user_id', 'Simple Track Event', anonymous_id='anonymousId',
  properties={
  'key1': 'val1'
}, context={
  'key1': 'val1'
})
```

For more information on the supported calls, refer to the [**documentation**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-python-sdk#sending-events-from-rudderstack).
